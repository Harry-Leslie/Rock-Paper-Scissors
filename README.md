# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

Welcome to the Rock-Paper-Scissors game! This project is built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, enhanced with Tailwind CSS for styling. The game offers three different AI modes for you to play against:

1. **Random AI**: The AI makes completely random choices.
2. **Statistical AI**: The AI uses a simple statistical model to predict your next move based on your past choices.
3. **Impossible AI**: The AI always wins (by knowing your choice in advance).
